# Low-Energy PCB Design for IoT

Designing PCBs for IoT applications presents unique challenges, especially when dealing with ultra-wideband (UWB) signals and low-power requirements.

## Design Considerations

### Power Management
- **Battery Life**: Target 5+ years on a single coin cell
- **Sleep Modes**: Implement multiple power states
- **Voltage Regulation**: Efficient DC-DC conversion

### Signal Integrity
UWB signals require careful attention to:
- **Impedance Matching**: 50Î© traces for RF signals
- **Ground Planes**: Solid ground planes to reduce noise
- **Via Placement**: Minimize via stubs

## 4-Layer Stackup

Layer 2: Ground Plane
Layer 3: Power Plane
Layer 4: Signal + Ground (Bottom)
```

## SoC Integration

Modern SoCs integrate multiple functions:
- **MCU**: ARM Cortex-M4 or similar
- **RF Transceiver**: UWB, BLE, or WiFi
- **Sensors**: Accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature

## Manufacturing Considerations

- **Component Placement**: Minimize trace lengths
- **Thermal Management**: Consider heat dissipation
- **Test Points**: Include test points for debugging

## Conclusion

Successful IoT PCB design requires balancing performance, power consumption, and manufacturability. Start with a solid foundation and iterate based on testing results.
