Capstone projects are a common rite of passage for engineering students. They show that four years of education can indeed manifest into real world contributions. Capstone's look different for each department and university, but they share common features. They are typically a semester or year long project that is designed to utilize the skills and knowledge of the student's major. Mechanical engineers typically design a system or mechanism, chemical engineers design a plant, and so on.

Going into Capstone I was excited, but also a bit nervous. Despite spending the last four years in school for engineering, you always have the fear of not being able to deliver.
Our professor, a seasoned veteran of teaching capstone courses, impressed upon us our responsibility to not bore him. Many projects were suggested by our cohort. Some notable ones include:
- Navigation aids using computer vision
- Gamified Cup Pong
- Workout related apps
- Labo-labs style
