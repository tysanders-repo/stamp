# Real-Time Data Processing Pipeline

Built a scalable data processing system that handles millions of events per second with sub-millisecond latency.

## Overview

This project focused on building a high-performance data processing pipeline capable of handling massive throughput with minimal latency.

## Technical Architecture

- **Event Processing**: Millions of events per second
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond processing times
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple nodes
- **Reliability**: Fault-tolerant design with redundancy

## Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: 1M+ events/second
- **Latency**: <1ms average processing time
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with node count

## Technologies Used

- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka
- **Data Processing**: Apache Flink
- **Storage**: Apache Cassandra
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
